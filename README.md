# zfs-snapbot
Auto snapshot script for ZFS.

This script is intended to be run at regular intervals and continuously, best
as a cron job (hourly or even more often depending on desired snapshot interval).

See zfs-snapbot.conf to configure snapshot interval and retention.
See install.sh to install as Launch Daemon under Mac OSX.
